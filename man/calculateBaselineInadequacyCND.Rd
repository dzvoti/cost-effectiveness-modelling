\arguments{
\item{householdConsumptionDf}{A dataframe containing household consumption data.}

\item{householdDetailsDf}{A dataframe containing household details.}

\item{nctListDf}{A dataframe containing nutrient composition tables.}

\item{intakeThresholdsDf}{A dataframe containing intake thresholds for nutrients.}

\item{aggregationGroup}{A character vector of administrative groups to aggregate the data. Must not be empty. Defaults to c("admin0Name", "admin1Name").}

\item{MNList}{A character vector of nutrients to be included in the analysis. If empty, defaults to a comprehensive list of nutrients.}
}
\value{
